# Sapio Studio

[Sapio Studio](https://github.com/sapio-lang/sapio-studio) is an in-development graphical user
interface for Sapio.

Currently, Sapio Studio works based on managing a WASM plugin directory, so that
users can more readily add contracts of their choosing.

Contracts packaged for WASM have some additional constraints or functionality
for aiding in the generation of a UX.
